This is a simple plugin for the Kate editor (http://www.kate-editor.org/)
It uses a QTcpServer to listen on some port and all data coming to the port 
is inserted into the working document. This was mainly an excercise to understand
Kate plugin building, but IMHO, it can be extended and modified to create something 
very useful. 

I have also written a detailed blog post explaining the whole thing, at
http://aniketpanse.in/blog/ So visit there for an in-depth tutorial.
